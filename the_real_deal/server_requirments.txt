1. Choose the port and host of each 'server'
2. setup the server_names or not
3. The first server for a host:port will be the default for this host:port (meaning it will answer
to all request that doesn't belong to an other sever)
4. setup deafualt error pages
5. limit client body size
6. setup routes with one or multiple of the following rules/configuration (routes wont be using regexp):
	- define a list of accepted HTTP Methods for the route
	- define a directory or a file from where the file should be search (for example
	if url /paouet is rooted to /tmp/www, url /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet is tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet)
	- turn on or off direcotry listing
	- default file to answer if the request is a directory
	- execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php)
		* You wonder what a CGI is go? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface
		* Because you wont call the cgi directly use the full path as PATH_INFO
		* Just remember that for chunked request, your server need to unchunked it and the CGI will 
		expect EOF as end of the body.
		* Same things for the output of the CGI. if no content_length is returned from the CGI, EOF 
		will mean the end of the returned data.
